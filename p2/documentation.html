                <p>The font, Karla, that I used on this site was designed by Jonny Pinhorn. The Javascript used to make the dropdown menu on the home page go directly to the page was adjusted from a sample Jim Habermas taught in my Web and Mobile II Class. The coding I personalized for the small cite menu open up was provided by W3C Schools.</p>
                <p>Overall, I found this difficult because I made the choice to use CSS Grid overall for the design, but didn't realize until I Was in too deep that using equal fr units for the rows was a mistake that hindered me when I made multiple pages that had different amounts of content and information in them. Figuring out the navigation so it would transition as the page expanded was tough and took a lot of effort to figure out. Overall, I have probably far too many divs and WAYYYY too much CSS code for a site like this. At some point I'd love to start the design part from scratch to make it clearer.</p>
                <p>I did not use any template or framework at all</p>
                <p>I think, although the presentation doesn't appear consistent with this at all times, my use of CSS grid was a huge element in me going above and beyond. I also implemneted Javascript in several parts of the project (a slideshow when applicable in each portfolio piece page, embedding a javascript game I made, embedding videos and websites I made using iFrame). I put a whole lot of time into this and I hope that it reflects in some way in my efforts</p>
